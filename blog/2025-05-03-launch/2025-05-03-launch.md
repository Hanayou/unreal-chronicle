# 🧭 Welcome, Traveler, to _Unreal Chronicle_

> _"When the shadows are long and the blueprints grow tangled, one must seek the wisdom of the tomes..."_

Greetings, brave soul!

You’ve stumbled upon **Unreal Chronicle – An Adventurer's Guide to Unreal Engine**. Whether by fate, fortune, or fumbling through a corrupted project file, you are welcome here. This is a place for all adventurers of game development—fresh apprentices or seasoned spell-casters of C++ and Blueprints alike.

## 🐉 The Tale So Far...

Many moons ago, I posted a [Steam Integration tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nMKEKV0acI) on my YouTube channel, and to my surprise... it resonated with many fellow devs!

<YouTube id="5nMKEKV0acI" title="Steam Integration in Unreal Engine" />

The response sparked something: whispers of requests for more, echoes of curiosity, and the realization that maybe, just maybe, there’s a fellowship out there looking for something better than what we’ve got now.

Still, I didn’t want to rush into battle unprepared. Life, after all, is filled with quests of its own—work obligations, family, and my own personal game dev project that gnaws at my attention like a hungry mimic. So I waited, sharpened my tools, and charted a path.

## ⚔️ The Dungeon of Existing Resources

Unreal Engine’s documentation is a decent spellbook... but for many brave adventurers—especially beginners or those mid-way through their journey—it often feels like it speaks in riddles.

Many of the tutorials out there suffer from cursed conditions:

- 📜 **Too vague**: Good outlines, but few practical, start-to-finish guides.
- 🔵🟦 **Divided camps**: Blueprint vs. C++ — few teach how they intertwine like fire and frost.
- ⏳ **Lost in the fog of time**: 30-40 minute videos, often hiding the one golden nugget of wisdom - like finding a needle in a haystack.
- 🔍 **Hard to find your way back**: Video formats make it tough to search or re-trace your steps quickly.
- 🔐 **Too specific**: You often learn how to copy the tutorial you're following—but not why it works. That leads to the familiar comments: "How do I add multiplayer?" or "How can I change it to X instead?" The arcane system remains locked without deeper understanding.

## 🛠️ A New Forge: What This Site Hopes to Be

**Unreal Chronicle** is my answer to all that.

Here's what I aim to create:

- ✨ **Concise, up-to-date guides** on real, day-to-day game dev workflows in Unreal Engine.
- 💡 **Cross-discipline knowledge**—both Blueprint and C++ working in harmony. C++ isn't the mystical, impossibly hieroglyphic language it may seem—it's absolutely worth learning. I want to help demystify it for those who’ve never dared venture beyond Blueprints.
- 📚 **Readable documentation**, for those who want to scan, refer, and learn at their own pace.
- 🎥 **YouTube video + written companion guides**, for visual learners _and_ those who prefer silent study.
- 🧙‍♂️ **A beginner's path**—a journey from novice to confident dev, with guidance every step of the way.

## 🏰 Join the Fellowship

This is just the first page in a tome I hope will grow into something vast and valuable. My hope is that these guides become helpful scrolls for those just starting out, or reference materials for fellow developers looking to polish specific skills.

So ready your tools, fellow traveler. The dungeons of Unreal Engine await.

### 📜 The Living Grimoire

This tome is not sealed.

The source code for **Unreal Chronicle**—including every scroll, diagram, and incantation—is open to brave souls via [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo-here). If you spot a troublesome typo-beast, unclear incantation, or an ancient spell in need of modern context, your contributions are most welcome.

Together, we build this Chronicle—not as lone mages in separate towers, but as a fellowship of knowledge-seekers crafting a clearer path through the Unreal wilds.

> _"The chronicle begins... and the guild assembles."_

See you in the next chapter.

🧙‍♂️ _– Hanayou, Chronicler of Unreal_

:::tip 🎮 Fun Fact: What's in a Name?

The name **Unreal Chronicle** is inspired not just by the fantasy genre at large, but also by one of my earliest and most magical RPG experiences: **_Dark Chronicle_** (known as _Dark Cloud 2_ in some regions), a magnificent and criminally underrated JRPG from Level-5. Its blend of gameplay, invention, and adventure left a permanent mark—and this site's name is a quiet tribute to that spark of wonder.
